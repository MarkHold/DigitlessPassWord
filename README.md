# DigitlessPassWord
Digitless password generator

The purpose of this project is to create a function that takes in a string and calculates the number of characters in the longest possible password.
The password has to follow 2 rules, it needs to contain at least 1 capital letter and cannot have any digits. This means that 
if the string is "bA0Xaa", the longest password would be Xaa since string gets split everytime there is a digit, and the function
will return the number 3. If there is no possibile password that fits the two conditions, the function will return -1. 

Keywords: Split, Arraylists, Algorithm, Java.
